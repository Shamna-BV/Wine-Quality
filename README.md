# Wine-Quality Prediction
This machine learning project  analyzes and predicts wine quality based on physicochemical properties using the Wine Quality Dataset. This dataset is widely used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks.
## üìù Project Overview
Wine quality is determined by various chemical properties, such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol levels, among others. This project aims to develop predictive models that classify wine quality scores, allowing winemakers and wine enthusiasts to gain insights into the factors that influence wine quality.

Using supervised learning algorithms, this project explores different approaches to classify wine quality and identifies the most influential features affecting the prediction.

## üìà Results and Insights

1. Correlation Analysis:
  * Alcohol and volatile acidity are significant predictors of wine quality.
  * Sulphates and residual sugar also influence quality ratings.

2. Model Performance:
  * Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 85%.
  * Gradient Boosting models like XGBoost performed well with an F1-score of 0.78.

3.Feature Importance:
  * Alcohol content was the most significant factor influencing quality, followed by sulphates and volatile acidity.
